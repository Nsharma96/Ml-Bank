# Project ML-Bank
This is a machine learning project made in python using pandas and sklearn libraries.The details for the dataset used in this project can be found here [Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).In this project we aim to build a classifier with good accuracy to maximize acquire percentage(Y%) and minimize marketing cost(X%)

# Goals achieved

As we can see Random Forest classifier gave the best accuracy. So, to reduce marketing cost and increase acquire percentage 
(Y%) we can make use of this classifier. This classifier requires 5 inputs that is ‘age’, ‘duration’, ‘month’, ‘day’ and
‘balance’ after which the classifier will predict the probability of ‘yes’ from a customer. Thus, this way we can make a list
with much more accuracy and thereby reducing marketing cost (as there will be less number of calls to be made) and increasing
Y%.
We can also make this classifier recurrent which with time will keep getting better and better. Thereby reducing human resource, time and money expenditure.
